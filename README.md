Welcome to my dev page!

If you're a hiring manager I recommend heading over to my [repos](https://github.com/shmibblez?tab=repositories) to the [Inferno project](https://github.com/shmibblez/Inferno), that's where I've been developing Inferno Browser. It's a mobile browser for android based on mozilla's Fenix browser and android components, mostly focused on added ui customizations and privacy.

You could also take a look at my [geocomb](https://github.com/shmibblez/geocomb-cpp) project, it's a location library that splits the globe into hexagons of chosen resolution, built with c++ with ports for use with Dart and WebAssembly. Here's an [interactive preview](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/hex-map-dev-z0qc0?file=%2Fsrc%2Fsketch.ts%3A49%2C24).
