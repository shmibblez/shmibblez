Welcome to my dev page!

If you're a hiring manager I recommend heading over to my repos to the Inferno project, that's where I've been developing Inferno Browser, a mobile browser for android based on mozilla's Fenix browser and android components, mostly focused on added ui customizations, ease of use and workflow.

You could also take a look at my geocomb project, it's a location library that splits the globe into hexagons, with support for different location resolutions.
