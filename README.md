# Welcome to my dev page ლಠ益ಠ)ლ

Here are some of my accomplishments

Top 1: [Inferno Browser](https://github.com/shmibblez/Inferno), a mobile browser for android based on mozilla's Fenix browser and android components, mostly focused on added ui customizations and privacy.

2nd: [chronos](https://github.com/shmibblez/chronos), a very cool metronome app with a very cool animation built with flutter. It has multiple indicators (blinking, sound, and vibration) and a preset storage system with json

Strong 3rd: [geocomb](https://github.com/shmibblez/geocomb-cpp), a location library that splits the globe into hexagons of chosen resolution, built with c++ with ports for use with Dart and WebAssembly. Here's an [interactive preview](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/hex-map-dev-z0qc0?file=%2Fsrc%2Fsketch.ts%3A49%2C24).
